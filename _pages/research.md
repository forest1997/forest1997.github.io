During my PhD study，a major theme of my research is about the application of optical coherence tomography, propeling medical diagnostics and forensic methodologies forward. Some projects include:
- [Multi-scale Multi-speed Optical Coherence Tomography Systems](#Multi-scale-Multi-speed-Optical-Coherence-Tomography-Systems)

## Multi-scale Multi-speed Optical Coherence Tomography Systems
- Developed a high-resolution 120kHz 850nm SD-OCT system with 4µm isotropic resolution using self-designed wavenumber linear spectrometer.
- Developed a 200kHz 1310nm SS-OCT system using Axsun laser with high SNR.
- Developed a 10MHz 1310nm SS-OCT system using Pulse-stretched Mode-locked Laser.
- The OCT systems were controlled by a custom-built, multi-threaded graphical user interface software created using the QT platform, written in C++.

## Robotic arm assisted large area OCT angiography
- Integrated OCT system into a 6-axis robotic arm to enhance its flexibility.
- Proposed a simple method for calibrating OCT and Robotic coordinate.
- Proposed an adaptive multiple-time interval OCTA with a time-efficient scanning protocol.
- High resolution and large field imaging of an irregular sample: micro-vascular image of whole mouse brain.

## Robotic-OCT guided inspection and microsurgery of monolithic storage devices
- Non-destructive detection of the underlying PCB traces of the MSD cards.
- With proposed continuous scanning strategy, the robotic-OCT provides automatic, precise, flexible, and repeatable imaging with an adjustable field-of-view (FOV).
- Combined with a laser ablation system, the robotic-OCT can serve as a microsurgical tool to selectively remove targeted areas of the insulating layer while only exposing relevant pins to enhance data recovery efficiency.
