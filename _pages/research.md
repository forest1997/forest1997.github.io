## Multi-scale Multi-speed Optical Coherence Tomography Systems
- Developed a high-resolution 120kHz 850nm SD-OCT system with 4Âµm isotropic resolution using self-designed wavenumber linear spectrometer.
- Developed a 200kHz 1310nm SS-OCT system using Axsun laser with high SNR.
- Developed a 10MHz 1310nm SS-OCT system using Pulse-stretched Mode-locked Laser.
- The OCT systems were controlled by a custom-built, multi-threaded graphical user interface software created using the QT platform, written in C++.
