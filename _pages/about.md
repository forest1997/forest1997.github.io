I obtained the PhD in July, 2024, in physics at Tsinghua University, working with Prof. [Ping Xue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RX_YGBEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

I am also the Co-Founder and Chief Scientist of Beijing Xiguang Technology.

My research interets are mainly in **Optical Imaging**. I have particular experience with **optical coherence tomography(OCT)**, **robotic arm assisted intraoperative imaging**, **novel forensic techniques** and **swept source laser**, but I am continually eager to delve into innovative techniques that hold the potential to **enhance human health and well-being**.
